# Architecture Decisions

| # | Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Status | Review Trigger |
|---|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|----------------|
| D1 | 2026-04-23 | P1 Scaffold tier = ent with Core.Obs→Scale + Deploy.Migration→Ent + Core.Error→Ent overrides | Structured log + metrics exporter baked at scaffold time (REQ-21 + U8); typed error handling foundational; migrate-first prevents runtime errors during deploy | Plain MVP scaffold (TIER_DRIFT against REQ-21); ship Obs in P5 only (duplicates infra) | active | Obs infra churns OR REQ-21 schema changes |
| D2 | 2026-04-23 | P2 FX = lazy read-through cache with PK+ON CONFLICT structural idempotency; integration tier override Data.Backup→Ent + Integration.Retry/Timeout→Ent | User model: per-pair-per-day cache triggered on transaction create, no daily cron needed; structural dedupe covers cold-start race at zero code cost | Daily batch cron (needs scheduler infra, out-of-scope); Redis SETNX dedupe (Scale overkill at scope-of-one); FX API write through no cache (N× external calls, cost+latency) | active | FX backfill/UPDATE path added OR external FX cost spikes |
| D3 | 2026-04-23 | P3 Auth tier = ent with MT.Row-isolation→RLS + Auth.RefreshToken→Ent rotating; CSRF stays MVP none | RLS load-bearing for SC-07/SC-08; ownership leak post-launch catastrophic; Firebase handles refresh rotation natively; bearer-token-only API immune to CSRF by design | WHERE tenant_id app-level (one missed query = leak); CSRF double-submit token (redundant for bearer); manual refresh endpoint (reinvents Firebase) | active | Cookie-based session added OR household multi-user MVP |
| D4 | 2026-04-23 | P4 Consent + DSR tier = ent baseline across 4 jurisdictions | Law 21.719 + GDPR + PIPEDA + CCPA/CPRA hard legal constraint, not ergonomics; audit event log required for DSR proof-of-processing | MVP `none` on audit (blocks per red-line); Scale immutable/WORM (overkill pre-launch) | active | New jurisdiction added OR enforcement action |
| D5 | 2026-04-23 | P5 Observability tier = ent with Core.Obs→Scale (REQ-21 exporter) | REQ-21 + U8 mandate structured logs + metric exporter at P1 exit; phase IS observability, exporter is the deliverable | MVP (TIER_DRIFT against REQ-21); defer to Phase 7 launch-hardening (breaks P1 exit-signal) | active | OTel/Prometheus replaced OR per-scan metric schema changes |
| D6 | 2026-04-23 | P6 Exit-signal smoke test tier = mvp | Happy-path E2E assertion only; no new infra, no new abstractions; proves P2–P5 integrate correctly per ROADMAP §Phase-1 exit signal | Ent with edge coverage (premature; edges land in per-feature phases later) | active | P1 REQ set expands |
| D7 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P1 Design language + tokens tier = **ent** (escalated from mvp 2026-04-23) | Multi-theme runtime (not single-winner-lock) + port legacy 3 themes × light/dark + 3 new candidates + 4-screen stress test × 3 platform frames (desktop web / mobile web / native mobile) = load-bearing for every downstream phase; MVP single-winner premise invalidated by user clarification | Stay mvp (invalid premise — user wants runtime multi-theme, not locked winner) | accepted | Stress-test screens expand OR runtime theme count changes |
| D8 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P2 Atomic components tier = mvp | Atoms simple; happy-path variants enough; state matrix belongs to P3 | Ent full states at atom level (duplicates P3) | accepted | P5-P12 atoms missing |
| D9 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P3 Molecular components tier = ent | Load-bearing for 9 screen phases; full state matrix + WCAG AA prevents compounded rework | MVP happy-path only (forces P13 re-audit) | accepted | 3rd platform added |
| D10 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P4 Flow map + REQ matrix tier = mvp | Living doc rewritten P5-P12; over-spec wastes effort | Ent upfront audit (premature) | accepted | P13 audit gaps |
| D11 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P5 Auth + onboarding + consent tier = mvp | Mockup-only; hardening in backend phases; consent copy legal review is separate gate | Ent (out of scope for mockup deliverable) | accepted | Legal review flags copy |
| D12 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P6 Core capture loop tier = mvp | Happy + 5 scan states cover surface; extended errors move to P12 | Ent (duplicates P12 scope) | accepted | Capture flow expands |
| D13 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P7 Batch + statement flows tier = mvp | Happy + basic errors (credit warn, encrypted pw); reconciliation edges at P12 | Ent (duplicates P12) | accepted | Statement flow expands |
| D14 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P8 History + items + insights tier = mvp | Standard list views | Ent (overkill for list patterns) | accepted | Data-view complexity spikes |
| D15 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P9 Trends + reports tier = mvp | Chart composition; empty/loading chart states at P12 | Ent (duplicates P12 edge coverage) | accepted | New chart types added |
| D16 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P10 Groups tier = mvp | 16 screens but each simple; split mid-phase if overwhelmed | Ent (no justification for 16 simple screens) | accepted | Group ownership model changes |
| D17 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P11 Settings + profile tier = mvp | CRUD forms | Ent (no justification for CRUD) | accepted | New settings surface |
| D18 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P12 Alerts + errors + offline tier = ent | Failure-mode surface drives reliability perception; aggregates extended edge states (permission denied, rate limited, session expired, payment failed, sync conflict, corruption recovery) | MVP (leaves handoff with undefined edge designs) | accepted | SCOPE tightens to happy-path ship |
| D19 | 2026-04-23 | ux-mockups P13 Handoff + index + audit tier = ent | Exit gate — REQ×screen audit + a11y pass + cross-screen consistency validates coverage claim; load-bearing for frontend phases | MVP handoff (broken coverage guarantee; frontend discovers gaps at impl time) | accepted | None — audit mandatory |
| D20 | 2026-04-24 | ux-mockups P1 T5 external render pass (6 themes × 4 stress × 3 platforms = 72 renders) superseded by direct production-surface authoring (14 desktop variants using locked tokens) | Production surfaces exercise tokens under real constraints (data density, responsive grids, component composition); stronger evidence than exploratory renders. `docs/mockups/STRESS-TEST-SPEC.md` retained as platform-frame reference. `docs/mockups/explorations/` stays empty with README noting supersession | Execute T5 MVS (18 renders) before building production surfaces (slower, validates less); defer T5 to P13 audit (too late, tokens already locked) | accepted | Theme count changes OR token structure breaks production surface |
| D21 | 2026-04-24 | /gabe-mockup suite retrofit — adopt peer-command architecture (/gabe-mockup ↔ /gabe-execute mutual redirect via `project_type: mockup` field). Added `.kdbp/ENTITIES.md` (9 principal entities). Landed `docs/mockups/assets/js/tweaks.js` (self-contained runtime Tweaks panel) from gabe_lens template; kept existing `docs/mockups/assets/css/desktop-shell.css` as canonical token source (P1 exit). Seeded `docs/mockups/INDEX.md` from template. P4 types renamed `[flows, index]` → `[mockup-flows, mockup-index]` + description upgraded to include 4-table INDEX governance + CRUD×entity matrix. P13 types renamed `[documentation, validation]` → `[mockup-docs, mockup-validation]`. STRUCTURE.md gained `docs/mockups/**/*.md` pattern row. HANDOFF.schema.json (Apache-2.0 derivative of impeccable DESIGN.json v2) available for P13 emission. Initial retrofit v1 landed `tokens.css` skeleton + `tweaks-panel.html` include file at mockups root; post-audit v2 deleted both — `desktop-shell.css` already canonical, and tweaks-panel.html `<link>`-to-HTML pattern is a deprecated/broken include (HTML Imports). tweaks.js now self-injects styles + panel DOM at boot. | Keep 13-phase plan hand-authored per project (next project reinvents); parallel lane architecture (complexity overhead); use `/gabe-execute` for mockup phases (no recipe fit — render-then-audit vs test-then-implement); duplicate tokens in fresh `tokens.css` alongside `desktop-shell.css` (drift risk); separate tweaks-panel.html file with `<link>` include (broken pattern) | accepted | Hybrid plans emerge requiring per-phase stream tagging OR additional mockup tier-sections needed |
| D22 | 2026-04-24 | Adopt centralized mockup hub pattern (gastify project level). Principal `docs/mockups/index.html` becomes a section-card hub (Design / Atoms / Molecules / Flows / Screens / Handoff); each section that produces many files gets its own `<section>/index.html` sub-hub (`atoms/index.html` already exists, `flows/index.html` + `molecules/index.html` placeholder added in this amendment). `tweaks.js` breadcrumb generalized from atoms-only path-match to section-aware logic (`/<section>/<name>.html` → `← <section> index`; `/<section>/index.html` → `← Mockups home`). Token migration on top hub: inline `:root` block → `desktop-shell.css` canonical tokens (small visual shift accepted). Playwright `hubs.spec.ts` covers hub navigability + breadcrumb chain. Layer B — extracting this hub + sub-hub + Playwright pattern into `gabe_lens/templates/mockup/` so `/gabe-mockup` seeds it on future projects — is queued as a separate follow-up, NOT in this Phase 4 amendment. | Hand-authored single hub per project (current state — works once but reinvents structure on every new project); flat list of files at mockup root with no section grouping (doesn't scale past ~20 files); deep nested per-screen-phase HTML hubs (overkill for Phase 4); skip the HTML hub entirely and rely on markdown INDEX.md alone (loses visual gallery affordance for designers + product reviewers) | accepted | Layer B template extraction lands OR a 3rd section type (beyond atoms/flows/molecules) needs hub treatment |

## D1 — Phase 1 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Scaffold + DB baseline
**Types:** deployment-release
**Tier chosen:** ent
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Foundational — structured logger + metrics exporter baked in at scaffold-time so REQ-21 + U8 instrumentation is ambient for all later phases, not bolted on. Migrate-first gated prevents runtime errors when schema + code deploy together.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)
- Deployment/Release: 2 dims kept, 2 suppressed

### Dimensions suppressed (Layer 2 filter)
- deployment-release.Feature-flags — reason: no feature code yet at scaffold
- deployment-release.Canary — reason: no prod targets yet at scaffold

### Grade overrides
- Core.Error-handling: default MVP → **Ent** (typed + retry). Reason: foundational error-handling posture used by every later phase — retrofitting is painful.
- Core.Observability: default MVP → **Scale** (structured + metrics exporter). Reason: REQ-21 + U8 require metric exporter at P1 exit; wiring at scaffold time avoids retroactive log-format migrations.
- Deployment-release.Migration-order: default MVP → **Ent** (migrate-first gated). Reason: Alembic deploy hook — new code waits on migration-ready signal. Avoids the "old code runs against new schema" window.

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 2 (Core.Testing, Core.Abstractions at MVP)
- S × 2 (Core.Error ΔE→S, Deploy.Rollback ΔM→E)
- M × 1 (Deploy.Migration ΔE→S — expand/contract deferred)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- Core.Testing at MVP (happy-path only) — edges land per-feature phase later
- Deploy.Rollback-plan at MVP (`git revert`) — no prod yet; escalate before first cutover

### Review trigger
- Before first production cutover: escalate Deploy.Rollback to Ent (prev-image revert) + Deploy.Canary to Ent (% traffic)
- When observability infrastructure (OTel collector, log pipeline) changes

### Status
- accepted

---

## D2 — Phase 2 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Money + currency + FX + i18n
**Types:** data, integration (revised from data, background-jobs)
**Tier chosen:** ent
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Financial-data backup red-line forces Ent; lazy FX model eliminates need for background-jobs section entirely. Retry + explicit timeout mandatory on transaction-create path.

### Type revision
Originally proposed `data, background-jobs` on assumption of daily scheduled FX fetch. User clarified actual model: lazy read-through cache, per-pair-per-day, triggered on first transaction of day in that currency. No scheduler. Revised types to `data, integration`.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)
- Data: all 4 dims
- Integration: all 4 dims (replacing Background-jobs)

### Dimensions suppressed (Layer 2 filter)
- None (all dimensions kept)

### Grade overrides
- Data.Backup/restore: default MVP `none` → **Ent** (daily snapshot). Reason: financial data red-line; `none` rejected by spec.
- Integration.Retry/backoff: default MVP `none` → **Ent** (exp backoff 3x). Reason: external FX APIs flake; retry preserves transaction-create path.
- Integration.Idempotency: default MVP `none` → **MVP-structural**. Reason: PK `(date, from_currency, to_currency)` + `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + re-read yields winning row. Cold-start race of 2 simultaneous transactions results in ≤1 duplicate external call (<$0.001 at scope-of-one), no data corruption. Effective Ent-tier behavior at zero code cost.
- Integration.Timeout: default MVP `default` → **Ent** (explicit 3s + fail). Reason: transaction-create path cannot block on stalled external; fallback = reject with retry hint.

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 3 (Core.Testing, Core.Abstractions, Data.Schema ΔM→E)
- M × 3 (Data.Migration ΔE→S, Integration.RateLimit ΔE→S, Integration.Retry ΔE→S)
- S × 2 (Core.Error ΔE→S, Integration.Timeout ΔE→S)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- Integration.Rate-limit at MVP (`hope`) — scope-of-one volume tolerates; escalate on first 429
- Data.Migration-safety at MVP — single-env dev deploy acceptable

### Review trigger
- FX backfill/UPDATE path added (structural idempotency breaks — escalate to job-ID dedupe Option B)
- External FX API bill exceeds budget (add Ent rate-limiting)
- Second FX provider added (side-effect-key dedupe Scale)

### Status
- accepted

## D3 — Phase 3 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Identity + ownership scope + RLS
**Types:** auth-session, multi-tenant
**Tier chosen:** ent
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** RLS correctness load-bearing for SC-07 (privacy by default) + SC-08 (sign-out isolation); ownership leak post-launch catastrophic. Bearer-token-only API design eliminates CSRF surface. Firebase covers refresh-token rotation natively.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)
- Auth/Session: 4 dims kept, 1 suppressed
- Multi-tenant: 3 dims kept, 1 suppressed

### Dimensions suppressed (Layer 2 filter)
- auth-session.Multi-tab-sync — reason: backend lane, not client; client lanes (P3/P4 future) handle
- multi-tenant.Noisy-neighbor — reason: scope-of-one MVP, no tenant contention possible

### Grade overrides
- Auth.CSRF: MVP `none` **accepted** (not escalated). Reason: API-only service with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers; no cookies, no ambient credentials, no CSRF surface. Mobile naturally immune. Spec red-line satisfied per "API-only services with bearer-token auth" exemption.
- Auth.Refresh-token: default MVP long-lived → **Ent** rotating. Reason: Firebase Auth handles refresh-token rotation natively — zero code cost.
- Multi-tenant.Row-isolation: default MVP `WHERE tenant_id` → **Ent** RLS policy. Reason: app-level `WHERE` clauses are opt-in — one missed query = ownership leak. Postgres RLS keyed off `ownership_scope_id` with deny-by-default policy is defense-in-depth mandatory for SC-07/SC-08.

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 2 (Core.Testing, Core.Abstractions)
- M × 3 (Auth.TokenRefresh ΔE→S, Auth.SessionInvalidate ΔE→S, MT.AuthZ ΔE→S)
- S × 3 (Core.Error ΔE→S, Auth.CSRF ΔE→S, Auth.RefreshToken ΔE→S)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- MT.Audit-logging at Ent (event log) — immutable/WORM deferred to Scale for compliance hardening later
- MT.AuthZ at Ent (per-tenant RBAC) — ABAC/OPA deferred until roles proliferate

### Review trigger
- Cookie-based session introduced (escalate Auth.CSRF to Ent double-submit token)
- Household multi-user MVP activates (scope-of-one → scope-of-N; re-test RLS policies)
- Second tenant-class added (per-tenant rate-limit Noisy-neighbor becomes relevant)

### Status
- accepted

---

## D4 — Phase 4 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Consent + processing register + DSR
**Types:** data, multi-tenant
**Tier chosen:** ent
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Four-jurisdiction compliance (Law 21.719 + GDPR + PIPEDA + CCPA/CPRA) is a hard legal constraint at MVP per SCOPE §9.4. Audit event log required to prove DSR processing.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)
- Data: 3 dims kept, 1 suppressed
- Multi-tenant: 3 dims kept, 1 suppressed

### Dimensions suppressed (Layer 2 filter)
- data.Indexing — reason: few lookups, simple consent-by-user queries
- multi-tenant.Noisy-neighbor — reason: scope-of-one MVP

### Grade overrides
- None — baseline Ent across all kept dimensions

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 2 (Core.Testing, Core.Abstractions)
- M × 5 (Data.Schema/Migration/Backup ΔE→S; MT.AuthZ/Audit ΔE→S)
- S × 1 (Core.Error ΔE→S)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- MT.Audit-logging at Ent event-log — immutable/WORM Scale deferred until first audit

### Review trigger
- New jurisdiction added (re-scope DSR endpoint coverage)
- Regulatory enforcement action against similar-class service
- Audit log volume exceeds queryable threshold (escalate to immutable sink)

### Status
- accepted

---

## D5 — Phase 5 tier: ent with Obs→Scale override (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Observability pipeline
**Types:** core-only
**Tier chosen:** ent (base) with Core.Observability upgraded to Scale
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** REQ-21 + U8 mandate structured logs + metric exporter + per-scan metric columns at P1 exit. The phase IS observability — exporter is the deliverable, not a nice-to-have.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)

### Dimensions suppressed
- None

### Grade overrides
- Core.Observability: Ent → **Scale**. Reason: REQ-21 specifies per-scan metric columns (`llm_tokens_in`, `llm_tokens_out`, `llm_cost_usd`, `scan_duration_ms`, `llm_latency_ms`, `queue_wait_ms`, `thumbnail_gen_ms`) + structured logs + metric export. Core tier ladder: MVP `print/log` → Ent `structured` → Scale `+metrics+traces`. Metric exporter is Scale-tier dim — upgrade mandatory.

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 2 (Core.Testing, Core.Abstractions)
- S × 1 (Core.Error ΔE→S)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- Core.Testing happy-path — load eval + fuzz deferred to Scale (not needed at launch volume)
- Core.Abstractions 1-interface — strategy+DI Scale deferred until 3+ exporter backends

### Review trigger
- Metric schema REQ-21 changes
- OTel/Prometheus replaced with other backend
- Per-scan metric count exceeds cardinality budget

### Status
- accepted

---

## D6 — Phase 6 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Exit-signal smoke test
**Types:** core-only
**Tier chosen:** mvp
**Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2 — happy-path E2E assertion, no new infra, no new abstractions. Proves P2–P5 integrate per ROADMAP §Phase-1 exit signal.

### Sections rendered
- Core (always, all 4 dims)

### Dimensions suppressed
- None

### Grade overrides
- None — all dims at MVP baseline

### Δ deferred by tier choice
- L × 2 (Core.Testing happy-path, Core.Abstractions inline) — deliberate; edge/load coverage lands in per-feature phases
- L × 1 (Core.Error fail-loud)
- M × 1 (Core.Observability print/log — phase uses existing P1 + P5 infra; no new log schema)

Load-bearing items deferred:
- None — smoke test is assertion-only; no production code surface

### Review trigger
- P1 REQ set expands
- Exit-signal definition changes in ROADMAP

### Status
- accepted

## Batch note — ux-mockups lane plan tier decisions (D7–D19)

**Scope:** All 13 phases of the ux-mockups lane plan created 2026-04-23.

**Domain note:** ux-mockups lane produces design deliverables (HTML mockups, tokens, flow walkthroughs, handoff docs) — not runtime code. The tier framework dimensions in `tier-section-index.md` (testing coverage, observability, scalability, data integrity, migration safety) are code-production-oriented and mostly moot for mockup artifacts. Per-phase matrix rendering was **batched** rather than rendered 13 times because nearly every design phase defaults to MVP with the same rationale. Where Ent is picked (P3, P12, P13), the reasoning is captured below. `--full-catalog` option remains available if mid-lane a phase warrants per-dimension scrutiny.

**Values alignment:**
- U2 (Plan Light, Build Real) — MVP default for 10 of 13 phases
- V5 (Prove It Works) — P13 audit tier = ent ensures evidence gate at lane exit

---

## D7 — ux-mockups P1 tier: ent (escalated from mvp 2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Design language + tokens
**Types:** `design-system`
**Tier:** ent | **Prototype:** no
**Reason (original mvp):** default MVP pick per U2. Theme exploration iterative; locking early premature. Tokens refine in P3 feedback loop.

### Tier escalation — 2026-04-23 (mid-phase, pre-exec)

- **From:** mvp → **To:** ent
- **Trigger:** user clarification + legacy investigation (mid-Phase-1, before any code shipped)
- **Root cause of escalation:** original D7 assumed single-theme-locked model (`pick winner → lock tokens`). User clarified + legacy `bmad/boletapp/docs/mockups/` evidence confirmed: gastify ships **runtime multi-theme** (Normal/Pro/Mono × light/dark = 6 variants alive in-app), not locked winner. Plus platform split expanded from 2 surfaces to **3 surfaces** (Desktop Web responsive / Mobile Web PWA limited / Native Mobile iOS+Android RN full). Plus stress-test methodology requires 4 screens × N themes × 3 platforms, not dashboard-only.
- **Reinstates dimensions:**
  - `design-system.Token-architecture` → Ent (multi-theme scheme with light/dark variants, not flat single-theme)
  - `design-system.Platform-frames` → Ent (3 platform conventions documented, not mobile-only)
  - `design-system.Stress-test-breadth` → Ent (4-screen stress test, not dashboard-only)
  - `design-system.State-matrix` → Ent (hero + variant states per screen per PLAN convention)
- **Reason (ent):** load-bearing for all downstream phases (P2 atoms, P3 molecules, P5–P12 screens) — a token-architecture mistake here propagates to 28+ screens. Legacy path proved the pattern works (boletapp `data-theme`+`data-mode` CSS strategy, 6 style prompts, 708-line gallery hub). Porting + extending is lower-risk than clean-slate rebuild.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Stay MVP single-winner-lock → invalidated by user: screenshots show runtime multi-theme, not single choice
  - Clean-slate per original PLAN note → discards 28 legacy screens + 13 flows + 6 style prompts = ~$work already paid

**Sections reinstated:** design-system (was suppressed under MVP rationale, now active at Ent)
**Review trigger:** Escalate further (scale) only if cohort theme customization per REQ-27 surfaces OR native platforms diverge enough to require per-platform token forks.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D8 — ux-mockups P2 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Atomic components
**Types:** `design-system, ui-kit`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Atoms are simple — happy-path variants enough; state matrix belongs to P3 molecules.
**Review trigger:** Escalate if P5-P12 screens need atomic variants missing here.
**Status:** accepted

### drift-accepted — 2026-04-24 (Phase 2 review)

- **Pattern:** `prefers-reduced-motion` reduce-handlers in `atoms.css` (`.skeleton::after` line 370 + `.spinner` line 456)
- **Tier floor:** Enterprise (per design-system tier section); phase tier remains mvp
- **Source:** /gabe-review consolidated pass (codex+claude both flagged as TIER_DRIFT-LOW)
- **Disposition:** keep code, accept drift — `prefers-reduced-motion` is unambiguously beneficial a11y; ripping it out to honor MVP tier would degrade vestibular-disorder UX. Drift is the right answer. No phase tier amendment.
- **Future trigger:** if a 3rd reduced-motion site appears in a non-atom layer at MVP tier, revisit whether to formally promote design-system.Motion to Ent in this phase's `dim_overrides`.

---

## D9 — ux-mockups P3 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Molecular components
**Types:** `design-system, ui-kit`
**Tier:** ent | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Molecular components are load-bearing infra for P5-P12 (nine screen phases). Full state matrix (default/hover/active/focus/disabled/loading/error) + WCAG AA contrast verification pays off because every screen reuses these. Under-specifying here creates rework compounded nine times.
**Δ deferred vs MVP:** MVP molecules happy-path-only → would force re-audit at P13 to fill gaps. Enterprise now = audit-once.
**Review trigger:** Escalate to scale if we add a 3rd platform (e.g., desktop native) beyond web + mobile.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D10 — ux-mockups P4 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Flow map index + REQ×screen matrix
**Types:** `flows, index`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Living doc rewritten through P5-P12; over-spec at creation wastes effort.
**Review trigger:** P13 audit will reveal if index gaps blocked coverage verification.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D11 — ux-mockups P5 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Auth + onboarding + consent
**Types:** `user-facing, auth`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Mockup artifact only — real auth hardening happens in backend phases. Consent screens render 4 jurisdictions per REQ-20 but legal review of copy is a separate gate outside mockup tier.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D12 — ux-mockups P6 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Core capture loop
**Types:** `user-facing, capture, ai-agent`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Happy path + 5 scan states cover the critical surface; extended error/edge states moved to P12 (ent tier) where they get dedicated attention. REQ-26 QR/CAF boleta scoped as mode option inside Idle state per user direction.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D13 — ux-mockups P7 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Batch + statement flows
**Types:** `user-facing, capture, reconciliation`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Happy + basic error coverage (credit warning, encrypted pw). Sync conflict + reconciliation edge cases land in P12.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D14 — ux-mockups P8 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** History + items + insights
**Types:** `user-facing, data-view`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Standard list views with established filter/sort/pagination patterns.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D15 — ux-mockups P9 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Trends + reports
**Types:** `user-facing, analytics, charts`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Chart composition exploration; multiple chart types covered but empty/loading/partial-data chart states move to P12.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D16 — ux-mockups P10 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Groups (shared expenses)
**Types:** `user-facing, multi-tenant`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. Largest phase count (16 screens) but each screen simple. Mid-phase split into sub-waves allowed per plan risk table.
**Review trigger:** Split phase if mid-phase exec reveals screen count is blocking progress.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D17 — ux-mockups P11 tier: mvp (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Settings + profile
**Types:** `user-facing, settings`
**Tier:** mvp | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** default MVP pick per U2. CRUD forms with live-preview for preferences.
**Status:** accepted

---

## D18 — ux-mockups P12 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Alerts + errors + offline states
**Types:** `user-facing, edge-cases`
**Tier:** ent | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Failure-mode surface is where users judge reliability. Happy-path-only mockups (pushed to P5-P11) hide the rough edges. This phase aggregates extended edge states — permission denied, rate limited, session expired, payment failed, sync conflict, data corruption recovery — in one place so the handoff engineer sees the complete failure taxonomy.
**Δ deferred vs MVP:** MVP errors cover only obvious states (offline, scan error) → handoff inherits undefined edge-state designs → frontend phases bake ad-hoc error handling.
**Review trigger:** Downgrade to mvp only if SCOPE tightens to happy-path MVP ship.
**Status:** accepted

## D19 — ux-mockups P13 tier: ent (2026-04-23)

**Phase:** Handoff + index hub + audit
**Types:** `documentation, validation`
**Tier:** ent | **Prototype:** no
**Reason:** Exit gate for all 12 prior phases. REQ×screen audit turns "we made mockups" into "we proved we covered SCOPE." MVP handoff (no audit, no a11y pass) = broken coverage guarantee — risk compounds because downstream frontend phases build from this deliverable.
**Δ deferred vs MVP:** MVP handoff HANDOFF.md-only, no audit → P12 output not verified complete → frontend phases discover gaps at implementation time.
**Review trigger:** None — audit tier is load-bearing for downstream frontend phases.
**Status:** accepted

## D22 — Centralized mockup hub pattern (Phase 4 amendment, 2026-04-24)

**Phase:** 4 — Flow map + INDEX + central hub (amendment, not a new phase)
**Types:** `mockup-flows, mockup-index`
**Tier:** mvp (unchanged)
**Prototype:** no
**Source:** `/gabe-plan update` invoked from inline `/plan` confirmation; user explicit "Layer A first, Layer B as follow-up"

**Pattern adopted:**
- One **principal** `docs/mockups/index.html` hub at the mockups root, with section cards per major content category (Design System, Atoms, Molecules, Flows, Screens, Handoff). Every section that produces many files gets a card; placeholder cards appear for not-yet-built sections so the hub is structurally complete from day one.
- Per-section **sub-hubs** at `<section>/index.html`. Each is a gallery of items in that section — currently `atoms/index.html` (10 atoms, built in Phase 2), `flows/index.html` (13 flow walkthroughs, built in this amendment), `molecules/index.html` (Phase 3 placeholder, built in this amendment).
- **Section-aware breadcrumb** auto-injected by `tweaks.js`: from any `/<section>/<name>.html` page, "← <section> index" links to `./index.html`; from any `/<section>/index.html` sub-hub, "← Mockups home" links to `../index.html`. The breadcrumb is rendered into the Tweaks panel header so every page has consistent navigation without per-page boilerplate.
- **Token alignment**: the existing top hub had its own inline `:root` block (lines ~13-27 of `docs/mockups/index.html`). Migrated to use `desktop-shell.css` canonical tokens (option a), accepting a small visual shift in exchange for theme-switcher consistency across the hub and the rest of the mockup surface.
- **Test coverage**: `tests/mockups/hubs.spec.ts` (renamed from `atoms-hub.spec.ts`) asserts principal hub loads, every section card link resolves, flows hub lists 13 cards, molecules placeholder reachable, and the full atom → atoms/index → mockups/home breadcrumb chain works.

**Reason — why centralize at this moment:**
- Phase 2 (atoms) shipped 10 atom HTMLs but `docs/mockups/index.html` had zero links to `atoms/index.html` — the atoms gallery was unreachable from the top.
- 13 flows existed at `docs/mockups/flows/flow-*.html` but were equally unreachable.
- Pattern stabilizes the convention: every new content section in P5-P12 (screens, handoff, edge-cases, etc.) gets a section-card on the principal hub + its own sub-hub. Linear scaling, low ceremony.

**Alternatives considered + rejected:**
- **Hand-authored single hub per project** (status quo): works once but reinvents structure on every new project; user explicit goal is reuse, so this fails the "Gustify" follow-up test.
- **Flat list of files at mockup root with no section grouping**: 58 screens + 13 flows + 10 atoms = unreadable wall of links past ~20 items.
- **Deep nested per-screen-phase HTML hubs** (e.g., `screens/auth/index.html`, `screens/capture/index.html`): overkill for Phase 4 mvp tier; section-level hubs are sufficient. Can split per-phase if individual sections balloon past ~30 items.
- **Markdown INDEX.md only, no HTML hub**: loses the visual gallery affordance designers and product reviewers want when scanning. Markdown INDEX.md stays as the engineer-facing 4-table doc (linked from the HTML hub).

**Δ deferred (Layer B):**
- L × 1 — **Layer B template extraction** to `gabe_lens/templates/mockup/`. Required to deliver the user's "next project gets it free" goal but explicitly out of scope for this Phase 4 amendment. Tracked separately as a follow-up; estimated 2-3h.

**Review trigger:**
- Layer B template extraction lands in `gabe_lens/` (revisit this entry then to record the extracted template paths).
- A 3rd section type beyond atoms / flows / molecules / screens / handoff requires hub treatment (revisit to confirm the per-section pattern still scales).
- The principal hub crosses ~12 section cards (revisit to consider grouping cards into super-sections).

## D23 — Per-platform mockup files (D18 cascade applied to mockups-legacy, 2026-04-27)

**Phase:** L2 — mockups-legacy: Molecules (in-progress amendment, not a new phase)
**Types:** `mockup-extracted, ui-kit`
**Tier:** mvp (unchanged)
**Source:** user invocation of `/gabe-mockup` after the suite-level skill ([`~/.claude/skills/gabe-mockup/SKILL.md`](~/.claude/skills/gabe-mockup/SKILL.md)) absorbed the gustify D18 convention.

**Pattern adopted:**
- **File triple per molecule.** Each molecule under `docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/` ships as four files:
  - `<slug>-mobile.html`   — wraps demo in `.screen-phone` (390 × 844)
  - `<slug>-tablet.html`   — wraps demo in `.tablet-surface` (820 × 1180)
  - `<slug>-desktop.html`  — wraps demo in `.desktop-surface` (1120 × 720)
  - `<slug>.html`          — landing page (3 platform-variant cards + composition crossrefs); preserves backlinks from anything that already linked the consolidated file.
- **Atoms unchanged.** Atoms have zero `@media` rules and render identically at every viewport, so per-platform files would be byte-identical noise. Single file per atom, no glyph in the atoms hub. Atoms HTML files lose any orphaned `body[data-viewport]` rules left over from the retired chip.
- **Tweaks panel viewport switcher retired.** `tweaks.js` no longer reads/writes `body[data-viewport]` and the chip is gone from the panel UI. Open the platform file directly to see the platform faithfully framed at any browser viewport.
- **Surface-scoped CSS overrides.** New section in `assets/css/molecules.css` keys layout adjustments on the wrapper class (`.screen-phone .toast { ... }`, `.tablet-surface .card-stat { ... }`, `.desktop-surface .toast { position: absolute; bottom: 24px; right: 24px; ... }`). This is the safety net that prevents `@media (max-width: …)` rules from firing desktop-style inside every surface when the file is opened on a wide browser viewport.
- **Surface chrome lives in `desktop-shell.css`.** `.screen-phone`, `.tablet-surface`, `.desktop-surface`, `.surface-frame`, `.surface-label`, `.not-applicable-here` are theme-token-aware and reusable from screens (L4) without copy-paste.
- **Helper script.** `scripts/gen_molecule_triples.py` defines per-molecule canonical demo + per-platform overrides (e.g., banner offline edge-bleed appears only in mobile, card-stat renders as 3-col grid on desktop / 2-col on tablet / stacked on phone). Discardable scaffolder — emits 4 files × N molecules, idempotent.

**Files generated for the 7 L2a molecules** (28 files total — 4 × 7):
- `banner` · `card-celebration` · `card-empty` · `card-stat` · `card-transaction` · `state-tabs` · `toast-system`

**Reason — why per-platform files instead of a single responsive file:**
- Trying to make ONE molecule render acceptably across mobile / tablet / desktop via a viewport chip + container queries forces design compromises (the "this kinda works at every width but isn't great at any" problem).
- More importantly, when three stacked surfaces (`.screen-phone` + `.tablet-surface` + `.desktop-surface`) appear in the same browser viewport, `@media`-driven CSS fires uniformly across all three — `bottom-nav { display: none }` at ≥ 1024px, `card-stat` grid layouts that respond to actual breakpoints, etc. Surface-scoped CSS partially mitigates this for `max-width` tweaks but cannot reach `display` / `position` / `grid-template` values that hinge on the actual viewport.
- File triples solve both: each file opens standalone, browser viewport matches surface dimensions, real `@media` rules fire correctly. Atoms get nothing because they have nothing to differentiate.

**Alternatives considered + rejected:**
- **Keep the viewport chip + add `body[data-viewport]` overrides for every responsive rule.** Tested: works for `max-width` clamps but fails for the layout-shift rules described above. Brittle as the molecule library grows.
- **Container queries (`@container showcase`) instead of viewport switcher.** Same blast radius problem — three nested containers, every `@container` matches based on the smallest one. Also forces all responsive rules to be containerized; raw `@media` becomes inert inside the wrapper.
- **Inline three-stacked-surface section in each consolidated `<molecule>.html`** showing the same demo at all three sizes. Failed in gustify cascade for the reasons above; documented in suite SKILL.md as the explicit anti-pattern.

**Forbidden patterns** (per the SKILL.md spec):
- Stacking multiple phone frames vertically per file. Use state-tabs for multi-state inside ONE frame.
- Authoring tablet variants via Tweaks chip. There is no chip.
- Adding `body[data-viewport=…]` rules anywhere — they're dead code now.
- Inserting a "Platform variants" section that renders three stacked surfaces showing the same demo.

**Δ deferred:**
- L × 1 — **L4 screens cascade.** Screens (P5–P12, deferred until L5) inherit the same convention: `<screen>-mobile.html` / `<screen>-tablet.html` / `<screen>-desktop.html` + landing. The `.screen-phone` / `.tablet-surface` / `.desktop-surface` helpers in `desktop-shell.css` are already in place.
- L × 1 — **Cross-platform parity audit at L5.** When the catalog phase runs, verify that the React port at `frontend/` honors the same surface-scoped invariants the file triples document.
- L × 1 — **Bespoke containers** (e.g., `.transaction-list-container` for showing a `card-transaction` inline inside a virtualized list, `.modal-overlay` for showing `card-empty` inside a popup) — author per-screen as L4 lands, not pre-emptively.

**Review trigger:**
- Any future molecule lands without all 4 files (signal: convention drift).
- Any screen in L4 lands as a single responsive file instead of a triple.
- The Tweaks panel grows a new "viewport-like" control (signal: re-revisit whether D23 still holds).
