## 2026-04-28 — [main bb934e1] feat(mockups): D18 file-triple cascade + KDBP audit (D23) + parallel validate-mode scaffold
FINDINGS: 3 (0 critical, 0 high, 2 medium, 1 low)
  - medium: tests/mockups/validate/runner.mjs — `.mjs` not in STRUCTURE.md test pattern (stream B / not-mine; accepted)
  - medium: tests/mockups/validate/rules.json — `.json` not in STRUCTURE.md test pattern (stream B / not-mine; accepted)
  - low (deferred): P11 — review-skip pattern persists on this commit too (user acknowledged + chose to commit)
ACTIONS: all-accept (per user "commit everything" override of just-approved plan)
DEFERRED: +P12 (5 broken molecule triples from D18 cascade — rebuild gated on R1+R2 enforcement landing first; see DECISIONS.md D23 + ~/.claude/plans/why-did-you-do-twinkling-lecun.md)
SCOPE: 3 independent workstreams bundled (D18 cascade + KDBP audit + parallel validate-mode scaffold). Honest multi-section commit message documents each.
NOTABLE:
  - D23 audit doc landed: documents WHY the suite's gates didn't catch the class-name hallucination (helper-script authors demos as Python literals; /gabe-review opt-in + skipped 5 phases running)
  - PENDING.md P12: explicit deferral with file paths + rebuild prerequisite (R1+R2 land first)
  - Tweaks panel viewport chip retired across all mockup files; surface chrome lives in desktop-shell.css
NEXT: implement R1 (class-name lint hook) + R2 (helper-script source extraction) per plan; then rebuild the 5 molecules through the new gates as proof they work.

## 2026-04-28 14:25 — SPIKE P15.0 EXECUTED: `/gabe-mockup validate` mode + per-screen validator

DISPATCH: ad-hoc `/plan` → codify validation in gabe-mockup as new `validate` mode (parallel shape to `spike`). One-pass GAN/PDD: design SKILL.md + templates, run on gastify, calibrate, run on gustify, calibrate, lock.

EMITTED:
- `tests/mockups/validate/runner.mjs` (orchestrator: architecture detection, screen enumeration, manifest, Playwright dispatch, MOCKUP-VALIDATION.md write with stable-ID merge)
- `tests/mockups/validate/screen-validator.spec.ts` (Playwright spec, data-driven from manifest, 4 check categories per (screen × viewport))
- `tests/mockups/validate/rules.json` (rule catalog + viewport widths 360/768/1440 + min-column 60px + skip patterns)
- `.kdbp/MOCKUP-VALIDATION.md` (live findings document, 0 active findings on gastify)
- `docs/mockups/VALIDATE-MODE-RECIPE.md` (project-specific recipe + run history table)

VERIFICATION:
- Architecture detection: `dynamic` with hybrid reason (tweaks.js + per-device *-desktop.html suffixes)
- 87 specs (28 base × 3 viewports + 3 desktop-only at desktop) ran in 14s
- 0 raw findings — gastify mockups are clean per C1/C2/C3 (C4 inert: no `applies-to: mockup-screens` rules in RULES.md)
- Stable-ID hashing uses `fingerprint || selector` for proper dedup (calibration #2 from gustify run)
- Skips `_*.html` template files + `index.html`

CALIBRATIONS UPSTREAM (template edits to gabe_lens during this run):
1. Hybrid architecture enumeration: shared file seeded to all viewports; per-device suffix overrides override per-viewport. Gastify-style projects no longer skip *-desktop.html files.
2. Skip leading-underscore template files (`_desktop-template.html`, `_filter-dropdowns.html`, `_nav-reference.html` — 3 files, 9 specs eliminated from gastify's run).

GATES:
- ✅ Validator boots, finds the manifest, runs Playwright, writes MOCKUP-VALIDATION.md
- ✅ Tablet viewport (768px) included alongside phone + desktop
- ✅ Validate spec is additive: lives at `tests/mockups/validate/screen-validator.spec.ts` and gracefully skips when invoked without runner.mjs env vars (`MOCKUP_VALIDATE_MANIFEST`, `MOCKUP_VALIDATE_FINDINGS_DIR`). Plain `npm test` reports it as 1 skipped, not 1 failure.
- ⚠ Pre-existing test failures: 44 atoms.spec.ts failures asserting `.legacy-section` visibility (line 53). Verified via `git stash` on clean main — failures persist without any of my validate work. Root cause is unrelated to Spike P15.0; tracked separately.
- ✅ Refrepos mirror (Layer 3): templates at `setup/cherry-pick/kdbp/templates/mockup/validate/` (6 files). Bench-tested in `mktemp -d` — install.sh recursive `cp -r` picks up the validate/ subtree alongside react/. 34 mockup template files now (was 28).
- ✅ Dual-home install: validate templates land at `~/.claude/templates/gabe/mockup/validate/` AND `~/.agents/templates/gabe/mockup/validate/`. SKILL.md "Mode: validate" section appears in both Claude Code and Codex CLI mode listings after restart.

NEXT (handed back to user):
- Pre-existing atoms-spec failures (`.legacy-section` not visible) are independent of this spike; tracking but not blocking.
- Validate-mode is now codified, calibrated against 2 architectures (dynamic-hybrid via gastify; per-device via gustify), mirrored, installed.

## 2026-04-27 17:30 — L2a BATCH 2 EXECUTED (mockups-legacy cards, 4 of 5; card-feature deferred)
DISPATCH: /gabe-mockup continue → Phase L2 batch 2 (cards)
EMITTED:
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/card-transaction.html (canonical, 571-line source — receipt thumb + emoji badge + merchant + amount + meta-pills + expandable items + selection + duplicate-flag + grouped border)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/card-stat.html (aggregate tile from AggregatedItemCard.tsx — icon block + name + total + meta pills with optional action-pill)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/card-empty.html (centered empty-state from HistoryEmptyStates.tsx + ItemsViewEmptyState.tsx — 3 sub-states: primary-with-CTA / filter-empty / duplicates-empty + 2 scales)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/card-celebration.html (PersonalRecordBanner — Trophy + title + message + dismiss + auto-dismiss 8s + is-leaving exit anim)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/assets/css/molecules.css (246 → 555 lines, +309 lines, 5 new sections incl. .card base + 4 variants, zero hex/rgb literals)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/index.html (4 catalog cards added with inline real-DOM previews; live count 3 → 7)
DEFERRED:
  - card-feature — no live frontend source. Settings entries are list rows not feature cards; insights BatchSummary is multi-row panel (better fit for future card-summary). Documented in SCREEN-USAGE.md as "skipped from L2a, revisit if hero pattern lands in L4."
SPEC-FLAG UX FIX (mid-batch):
  - banner.html: dropped floating ::before pseudo-badge ("speculative — not in live frontend") that was absolute-positioned and clipping into adjacent banner content (per user screenshot feedback).
  - Replaced with ⚠ inline marker tied to existing (speculative) text in swatch labels — semantic data-speculative attribute kept, no visual chrome.
CROSS-REFS UPDATED:
  - atoms/button.html "Used by molecules" → adds card-empty (CTA) link
  - INDEX.md §1 phase-status: 3 → 7 of ~18
  - INDEX.md §2 atoms table: button "Used by molecules" → banner + card-empty
  - INDEX.md §3 molecules table: 4 new card rows + speculative card-feature row collapsed to remaining-list
  - INDEX.md last-updated bumped
  - mockups-legacy/index.html principal hub: meta-pills 3→7, Molecules card preview list updated
  - SCREEN-USAGE.md: 4 new molecule sections + card-feature DEFERRED section
PLAN BOOKKEEPING:
  - Current Phase prose: batch-2 paragraph appended; batches 3-5 outlined; scan-mode-selector noted as future FAB/sheet sibling per user screenshot
TRACE METHODOLOGY (per molecule):
  - card-transaction: TransactionCard imports → 3 views (RecentScansView, DashboardView, HistoryView) ✅ heavy. Disambiguated 2 source files; history/components/TransactionCard.tsx is dead code (zero consumers, kept for git history).
  - card-stat: AggregatedItemCard → 1 view (ItemsView) ⚠️ thin but real
  - card-empty: HistoryEmptyStates → HistoryView (3 sub-states); ItemsViewEmptyState → ItemsView (filter-empty only) ✅
  - card-celebration: PersonalRecordBanner wired but no production trigger; CelebrationView is placeholder per Story 14.33d ⚠️ wired-but-not-fired
VERIFICATION: smoke-test pending (next step) — http-server :4176 + curl 200 check + zero-hex-literal grep
NEXT: smoke-test all 4 cards; user review before continuing to batch 3 (modals + sheet + drawer)

## 2026-04-27 16:55 — L2a BATCH 1 EXECUTED (mockups-legacy molecules, 3 of ~18)
DISPATCH: /gabe-mockup auto-mode → Phase L2 batch 1
EMITTED:
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/banner.html (atom-composing, 4 variants: info/warning/error/offline-edge-bleed; consumes button atom)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/state-tabs.html (canonical primitive: pill+sliding-indicator + simple-flat variant; sourced from ItemViewToggle.tsx)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/toast-system.html (system layer: .toast-stack + .is-leaving + useToast hook contract; wraps L1 toast atom)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/assets/css/molecules.css (17 → 237 lines, 3 sections, zero hex/rgb literals)
  - docs/mockups-legacy/molecules/index.html (sub-hub flipped placeholder→live, 3 catalog cards with inline real-DOM previews)
CROSS-REFS UPDATED:
  - atoms/button.html "Used by molecules" → links banner.html (closes bidirectional contract)
  - atoms/toast.html "Used by molecules" → links toast-system.html (closes bidirectional contract)
  - INDEX.md §1 phase-status: L2a ⬜ → 🔄 (3 of 6 batches)
  - INDEX.md §2 atoms table: button "Used by molecules" placeholder → live banner link; toast → live toast-system link
  - INDEX.md §3 molecules table: 3 catalog rows populated with sources + variants + atom deps
  - mockups-legacy/index.html principal hub: Molecules card placeholder→live; meta-pill "11 atoms ✅ · 3 molecules ✅"
PLAN BOOKKEEPING:
  - Phases table: L2 row Exec ⬜ → 🔄
  - Current Phase prose: explains batch 1 completion + suggested batches 2-5 for remaining 15
  - Retrofit Log: 2026-04-27 L2a batch 1 entry appended (drift-vs-clean-slate: BEM-lite class names, frontend-token vocabulary)
DRIFT NOTES:
  - toast-system intentionally diverges from clean-slate `toast.html` — splits atom-render (L1) from positioning + hook contract (L2). Single-toast semantics from live useToast.ts (NOT spike P14.0's queue+max3+FIFO).
  - banner uses BEM-lite (.banner--warning) instead of clean-slate's .is-warning, matching L1 atom convention
VERIFICATION: deferred to next /gabe-mockup run (smoke-test: http-server :4173 + Playwright snapshot per molecule × Normal Light/Dark)
NEXT: continue L2a batch 2 (cards: transaction / stat / empty / feature / celebration) via /gabe-mockup

## 2026-04-27 16:35 — PLAN UPDATED: advance to L2 + retro-tick bundled phases
CHANGE: Current Phase L1 → L2 (mockups-legacy Molecules; three sub-phases L2a/L2b/L2c). Retro-ticked Commit+Push ✅ for Phase 3 (Molecules), Phase 4 (Hub layer D22), Phase L0 (mockups-legacy Foundation), Spike P14.0 (Mockup→React) — all four shipped in be9aefd and pushed in P5 (origin/main 16:30). Review columns remain ⬜ for these four; no /gabe-review pass occurred. PENDING.md P11 tracks the retroactive review backlog. Last Updated bumped to reflect retroactive correction.
SCOPE: structural fix — column state now matches deployment reality for P3/P4/L0/Spike P14. Future /gabe-review on those phases will flip Review ⬜ → ✅ when they actually run.
NEXT: start L2a via /gabe-execute or /gabe-mockup. ~18 direct-counterpart molecules from frontend/src/features/.

## 2026-04-27 16:30 — PUSH main -> origin/main
PR: — (trunk-based; direct push, no PR hop)
CI: skipped (provider=none)
PROMOTION: N/A (origin/staging does not exist; promote_from=staging skipped silently per Step 3)
DEPLOYMENTS: P5 added to .kdbp/DEPLOYMENTS.md
SOURCE: Phase L1 exit-push — 3 commits since P4. Tip: c69447d (chore: bookkeeping for be9aefd) preceded by be9aefd (5-phase catch-up: P3 molecules + P4 hub + Spike P14 + L0 + L1 + /gabe-review L1 fixes).
TICK: ✅ Phase L1 Push auto-ticked

## 2026-04-27 — [be9aefd] feat: ship P3/P4 + spike P14 + L0/L1 + L1 review (5-phase catch-up)
SCOPE: 5-phase catch-up commit per /gabe-commit [B] commit-all. 1184 files staged, +154970/-157.
PHASES BUNDLED:
  - P4 Hub layer D22 (2026-04-24): principal index.html + sub-hubs + tweaks.js breadcrumb + hubs.spec.ts
  - P3 Molecules (2026-04-25): 18 molecules at docs/mockups/molecules/ + molecules.css + COMPONENT-LIBRARY.md
  - Spike P14 Frontend (2026-04-26): full React+Vite+TS at frontend/ — toast molecule + ~50 components + mocks
  - L0 Foundation (2026-04-27): docs/mockups-legacy/ scaffold extracted from frontend/index.html
  - L1 Atoms (2026-04-27): 11 atoms + atoms.css + categories.html + icon.html + 115-icon emoji↔pixel toggle
  - /gabe-review L1 (2026-04-27): cross-agent Codex+Claude union, all 9 findings fixed in same session
TICK: ✅ Phase L1 Commit auto-ticked
TICK-DEFERRED: P3 / P4 / Spike P14 / L0 Commit columns remain ⬜ (only Current Phase auto-ticks per /gabe-commit Step 6.6) — retroactive correction pending
CHECKS: ✅ tests (91/91) | – lint (no biome) | – types (no tsconfig) | – coverage (mvp skip) | – shape (HTML/CSS excluded)
FINDINGS: scope flagged HIGH at triage; user picked [B] commit-all over [A] scope-l1-only. STRUCTURE.md does not yet match docs/mockups-legacy/** or frontend/** — accepted with this commit, register patterns in follow-up.
PIXEL BUDGET: 0 / 2000 used (107 category PNGs + 8 nav PNGs mirrored from BoletApp existing set)

## 2026-04-27 19:15 — PHASE L1 REVIEW: mockups-legacy Atoms
VERDICT: APPROVE
FINDINGS: 9 total (0 critical, 3 high, 3 medium, 3 low)
COVERAGE: HIGH — `npm test` 87/87 pass; new `mockups-legacy` Playwright project covers 11 atoms × 6 theme/mode combos + ARIA contract + on-primary contrast smoke
CONFIDENCE: 100/100 (was 33 pre-fix; all 9 findings fixed in same session per option [1] Fix MVP items)
DEFERRED: none (P11 added to PENDING.md tracks retroactive review of Phases 3, 4, L0 — surfaced by finding #6 but is meta-cleanup not a deferral)
ALIGNMENT: DRIFTED — diff mixes L1 work with KDBP adjacencies + clean-slate INDEX.md fix + new tests/mockups-legacy spec; non-blocking
TIER: mvp | DRIFT: none
SOURCES: codex (gpt-5, inbox pass, 6 findings) + claude (claude-opus-4-7, blind pass, 9 findings) — union consolidation, fuzzy F1+F2 auto-accepted as Claude superset
TICK: ✅ Phase L1 Review column ticked
ARCHIVED: .kdbp/reviews-archive/REVIEW_2026-04-27_191500_resolved.md
KEY FIXES: per-theme on-color ink tokens added to desktop-shell.css × 6 theme blocks (--on-primary, --on-error, --on-warning, --on-accent + shadow/focus-ring/chip-count tokens); 8 #ffffff literals + 5 rgba literals removed from atoms.css; 13 progress demos got role=progressbar + aria-valuenow|aria-busy + aria-label; playwright.config.ts gained second webServer + project; tests/mockups-legacy/atoms.spec.ts authored (24 tests); README L0/L1 status flipped to ✅; INDEX atom count 11→10 + molecule count 17→18; PLAN inline comment + PENDING P11 entry document the no-arg /gabe-review collision.

## 2026-04-26 — SPIKE P14.0 EXECUTED: Mockup→React (Toast molecule)
SOURCE: /gabe-mockup spike toast --system (first invocation of the new spike mode)
GOAL: validate the recipe codified in gabe_lens/skills/gabe-mockup/SKILL.md "Mode: spike" by walking it end-to-end on a live mockup
SKILL CHANGES (in /home/khujta/projects/gabe_lens/):
  L1 — skills/gabe-mockup/SKILL.md: new "Modes" section + "Mode: spike" subsection (S1-S8 recipe + verification gate + idempotency rules + error recovery) + "Shared conventions — React port" + non-goal #4 reframed (M0-M13 framework-agnostic; spike is opt-in framework coupling)
  L2 — templates/mockup/react/ NEW SUBTREE (16 files):
       package.json.tmpl · vite.config.ts.tmpl · tsconfig.json.tmpl · index.html.tmpl · README.md.tmpl
       src/main.tsx.tmpl · src/App.tsx.tmpl · src/styles/tokens.css.tmpl
       src/components/{Component.tsx, Component.css, Component.types.ts, ComponentProvider.tsx, ComponentContainer.tsx, useComponent.ts}.tmpl
       src/demo/ComponentDemo.tsx.tmpl
       recipe/REACT-PORT-RECIPE.md.tmpl
GASTIFY EMISSIONS (15 files):
  frontend/{package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, index.html, README.md}
  frontend/src/{main.tsx, App.tsx, styles/tokens.css}
  frontend/src/components/Toast/{Toast.tsx, Toast.css, Toast.types.ts, ToastProvider.tsx, ToastContainer.tsx, useToast.ts}
  frontend/src/demo/ToastDemo.tsx
  docs/mockups/REACT-PORT-RECIPE.md
VERIFICATION:
  tsc --noEmit → clean (no type errors)
  vite build → clean (37 modules transformed, 65.93kB CSS bundled — confirms @import chain to desktop-shell.css + atoms.css + molecules.css resolves through @mockups alias)
  npm install → clean (2 unrelated transitive vulns, non-blocking)
  Visual diff at runtime → deferred to user (requires browser at localhost:5173 vs. localhost:4173)
TEMPLATE CALIBRATION (real-time edits during the spike):
  - Renamed Component.module.css.tmpl → Component.css.tmpl (Vite scopes .module.css class names; broke DOM-mirroring rule)
  - Component.tsx state `isLeaving` → `isDismissing` (matches existing molecules.css `.toast.is-dismissing` selector verbatim)
  - SKILL.md S3 step + spike-mode outputs section updated to reflect both fixes
PLAN/SCOPE IMPACT:
  - .kdbp/PLAN.md: new "Spike P14.0" row added below row 13 (Exec ✅; Review/Commit/Push ⬜); Retrofit Log entry appended documenting out-of-band nature ahead of queued backend P1
  - .kdbp/SCOPE.md: untouched (this is a workflow spike, not a SCOPE addition)
  - .gitignore: untouched (existing `node_modules/` and `dist/` patterns already cover frontend/)
NEXT: refrepos mirror of templates/mockup/react/ + bench-test in tmp project; gastify regression check (npm test still 63/63); user-side visual diff in browser.

Bundles Phase 2 atoms (this session — Tweaks rebuild, Space Grotesk, atoms gallery, legacy reference, viewport toggle, 43-spec harness) + Phase 4 hub seeds (root index.html, flows/index.html, molecules/, gap-matrix.html landed via prior session linter). Phase 4 hub work itself remains in P4 scope.
NOTABLE: legacy-snapshots/ committed (Layer A dump + Layer B Playwright extracts); 4 woff2 weights for Space Grotesk added.

## 2026-04-23 — [a37fd59] feat(mockups): canonical filter strip — timeframe pills + period-nav + L1/L2/L3/L4 taxonomy chips, retrofit Dashboard/History/Trends
FINDINGS: 0
ACTIONS: none
SCOPE: extracted BoletApp legacy filter UX (useHistoryFiltersStore) into shared `assets/css/desktop-shell.css` + paste-ready partial `screens/_filter-dropdowns.html`. Retrofitted Dashboard/History/Trends. Category modal uses 4 V4 taxonomy chips L1–L4 + Lugar (not legacy's 3-tab Receipt/Package/MapPin).

## 2026-04-23 — LANE ROLLBACK: drop `.kdbp/lanes/` layout → serial single-plan
SCOPE: rolled back Gabe Suite lane/parallelism feature. `.kdbp/lanes/ux-mockups/` promoted to `.kdbp/PLAN.md`. `.kdbp/lanes/p1-backend/` parked at `.kdbp/archive/queued_backend-p1.md` (activate post-UX handoff). `.kdbp/lanes/default/` discarded (empty template). Worktree `.worktrees/p1-backend/` removed + branch `gabe/p1-backend` deleted (content preserved in archive + `pre-rollback-snapshot` tag).
RATIONALE: complexity of parallel UX + backend stream did not pay off at mvp maturity. Serial plan (mockups first, backend second) is the match.
GABE SUITE: also rolled back — `~/.claude/commands/gabe-lane.md` removed; gabe-{init,commit,push,plan,execute,next,teach,review,help,scope*} restored to pre-lane heads + 5 non-lane improvements cherry-picked (push auto-commit bookkeeping, plan Core-as-table invariant, plan per-dim tier override data model, plan check subcommand, execute/review per-dim consumers).
RECOVERABILITY: `pre-rollback-snapshot` tags on both repos; `lane-archive` branch on gabe_lens preserves full lane work.

FROM: mvp → TO: ent
TRIGGER: user mid-exec intervention — hand-rolled HTML rejected as low-fidelity vs legacy; legacy inspection revealed runtime multi-theme model + 3 platform surfaces + 4-screen stress-test convention not captured in original MVP plan
ROOT CAUSE: original D7 presumed single-theme-locked model; user + legacy evidence show runtime multi-theme (Normal/Pro/Mono × light/dark = 6 variants in-app) + 3 platform frames (Desktop Web / Mobile Web PWA / Native Mobile RN) + legacy stress-test methodology
DECISIONS: D7 amended with escalation block
REINSTATED: design-system.{Token-architecture, Platform-frames, Stress-test-breadth, State-matrix} → Ent
DISCARDED: 5 hand-rolled theme dashboard HTMLs (uncommitted, zero-cost rollback)

## 2026-04-24 18:30 — PLAN UPDATED: Phase 4 amendment (centralized mockup hub)
SOURCE: /gabe-plan update (invoked from inline /plan confirmation)
SCOPE ADDITION TO PHASE 4 (tier unchanged: mvp):
  A1 — Restructure docs/mockups/index.html as principal hub with section cards (Design / Atoms / Molecules / Flows / Screens / Handoff); migrate inline :root tokens → desktop-shell.css canonical (option a)
  A2 — Build docs/mockups/flows/index.html sub-hub (13 flow cards)
  A3 — Build docs/mockups/molecules/index.html placeholder (P3 stub)
  A4 — Generalize tweaks.js breadcrumb → section-aware
  A5 — Rename atoms-hub.spec.ts → hubs.spec.ts; add hub navigability + breadcrumb chain coverage
  A6 — Cross-reference docs/mockups/INDEX.md + atoms/INDEX.md → principal hub; add Navigation section to mockups/INDEX.md
DECISIONS: D22 logged (centralized hub pattern adopted, Layer B queued)
TIER CHANGES: 0 (Phase 4 stays mvp)
DIM_OVERRIDES: 0 (Phase 4 dim_overrides remains [])
LLM CALLS: 0 (structural amendment, no tier re-render)
FILES TOUCHED: .kdbp/PLAN.md (Last Updated, Phases row 4, Phase 4 Details Scope, Retrofit Log) · .kdbp/DECISIONS.md (D22 row + full prose entry)
NEXT: /gabe-execute on Phase 4 (or /gabe-next to dispatch)

## 2026-04-24 17:30 — PHASE 2 REVIEW: Atomic components (cross-CLI consolidated)
VERDICT: APPROVE (post-triage; provisional WARNING upgraded after 7/7 fixed)
FINDINGS: 7 total (0 critical, 2 high, 2 medium, 3 low) | SOURCES: codex/gpt-5 + claude/opus-4-7 (4 strict-overlap corroborated, 3 claude-only, 0 codex-only)
COVERAGE: MEDIUM — no automated a11y check on atom layer; INDEX.md Known Gaps surfaces residual M13-audit items
CONFIDENCE: 55 → 95 / 100 (+40, all 7 findings resolved)
DEFERRED: none added this run; PENDING.md P1-P5 unchanged (none touch atoms surface)
ALIGNMENT: DRIFTED (atom desktop-only vs phase row "Web + mobile" — non-blocking; atoms responsive by nature, mobile composition deferred to P3 molecule layer per recommendation)
TIER: mvp | DRIFT: 2 findings (1 fixed via downgrade — pill role removal; 1 accept-drift — prefers-reduced-motion logged on D8)
TICK: ✅ (Review column Phase 2)
FIXES APPLIED:
  F1 → desktop-shell.css [data-theme="mono"][data-mode="dark"] block: --primary-ink override #09090b (~9:1 contrast)
  F2 → progress.html: role=progressbar + aria-valuenow/min/max added to 4 semantic-color demos + 5 value-stage demos + 5 circular demos
  F3 → pill.html: dropped role=tablist/role=tab from atom demo, replaced aria-selected with aria-pressed (atom layer = visual only; tab semantics moved to P3 molecule contract)
  F4 → atoms.css: --progress-mask token (default var(--bg)), molecule consumers override with style="--progress-mask: var(--surface);"
  F5 → DECISIONS.md D8: drift-accepted note for prefers-reduced-motion (Enterprise-tier pattern in MVP phase, beneficial a11y kept)
  F6 → atoms/INDEX.md catalog row Badge: removed phantom xs size column entry
  F7 → desktop-shell.css: new --overlay-soft token across all 6 themes (rgba(0,0,0,0.08) light / rgba(255,255,255,0.08) dark); atoms.css 3 sites tokenized; functional alpha literals (shimmer, spinner ring, active-pill count bubble, btn-destructive #fff) retained with documented rationale in INDEX.md Known Gaps GAP-2/3/4

## 2026-04-24 — PHASE 4 EXECUTED: centralized hub + section sub-hubs (Layer A)
PHASE: 4 (mockup-flows, mockup-index, mvp tier)
EXEC: ✅ (column flipped ⬜ → ✅; Review/Commit/Push remain ⬜)
SOURCE: /home/khujta/projects/gabe_lens/docs/LAYER-B-MOCKUP-HUB-TEMPLATES.md preconditions + D22 amendment in PLAN.md Phase 4 Details
A1 — Renamed legacy `docs/mockups/index.html` (P5–P12 gap matrix) → `gap-matrix.html` (preserved). New `index.html` is section-card hub: Design System / Atoms / Molecules / Flows / Screens / Handoff. Tokens via desktop-shell.css canonical (no inline :root). Each card has data-section + data-status="live|placeholder".
A2 — `docs/mockups/flows/index.html` created. 13 live flow cards (F1–F13) + 7 planned (F14–F20). Card pattern matches atoms/index.html. Footer back-link to `../index.html`.
A3 — `docs/mockups/molecules/index.html` created. Placeholder banner + 7 planned molecule cards (balance-card, transaction-card, state-tabs, filter-strip, nav-bottom, nav-sidebar, fab). All non-interactive divs with status="planned".
A4 — `assets/js/tweaks.js` breadcrumb generalized. Atoms-only path-match replaced with section-aware logic: `/<section>/<page>.html` → "← <Section> index" → ./index.html; `/<section>/index.html` → "← Mockups home" → ../index.html; `/<top-level>.html` (non-index) → "← Mockups home" → ./index.html; `/index.html` → no breadcrumb (it IS home).
A5 — `tests/mockups/atoms-hub.spec.ts` → `tests/mockups/hubs.spec.ts` (renamed + generalized). Added describe blocks: Top hub (5 specs), Atoms sub-hub (5), Flows sub-hub (4), Molecules sub-hub (3), Breadcrumb chain (2). Total 19 specs in this file.
A6 — npm test: 43 passed, 0 failed (was 33 before; +10 from new hub coverage in hubs.spec.ts).
FILES TOUCHED: docs/mockups/{index.html (new section-card), gap-matrix.html (renamed-from-old), flows/index.html (new), molecules/index.html (new), assets/js/tweaks.js (breadcrumb logic)}, tests/mockups/{hubs.spec.ts (renamed-from-atoms-hub.spec.ts + generalized)}, .kdbp/PLAN.md (Phase 4 Exec ✅).
NEXT: Layer B execution in /home/khujta/projects/gabe_lens/ — extract this hub + sub-hub + Playwright pattern into `templates/mockup/` so future mockup projects get it from `/gabe-mockup` for free. Per LAYER-B-MOCKUP-HUB-TEMPLATES.md D1–D8.
